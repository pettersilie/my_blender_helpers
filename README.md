This Blender Addons includes useful tools for generating Clouds, Rocks, Trees and so on.
The last blender upgrade deleted all my work completely, so I need to start over.
Feel free to use it but there is no warranty at all and no support. I am trying to document everything, but it is not my priority.
Have fun!
